## Why Learn ASP.NET Core 6 and Angular?

**ASP.NET Core 6** is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It allows you to build web APIs, web applications, and microservices.

**Angular**, on the other hand, is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google. It allows you to build dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) with a clean, component-based architecture.

Combining these two technologies offers several key advantages:

*   **Full-Stack Development:** Build both the front-end and back-end of your applications with robust, industry-standard technologies.
*   **Performance and Scalability:** ASP.NET Core 6 is optimized for performance, while Angular offers features like lazy loading and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation for faster load times.
*   **Modern Architecture:** Embrace a modern component-based architecture for cleaner code and easier maintenance.
*   **Job Opportunities:** Demand for developers skilled in ASP.NET Core and Angular is high and continues to grow.
