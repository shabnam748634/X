## Athletic Training Tape: A Deeper Dive

Beyond just application techniques, a strong understanding of the materials and underlying principles of athletic training tape is crucial.

*   **Types of Athletic Tape:** White athletic tape is the most common, used for its rigid support. Elastic tape, often called "stretch tape," provides compression and allows for some movement. Kinesiology tape is a thinner, more flexible tape believed to affect muscle function and lymphatic drainage. Cohesive tape sticks to itself, providing compression without needing clips.
*   **Adhesive Properties:** The quality of the adhesive determines how well the tape stays in place. Look for hypoallergenic adhesives to minimize skin irritation.
*   **Tape Widths:** Different widths are used for different body parts and applications. Narrower tapes are better for smaller joints and intricate taping patterns.
*   **Proper Removal:** Removing tape carefully is as important as applying it correctly. Use tape removers to dissolve the adhesive and minimize skin trauma.

While this free course is a great starting point, consider exploring these additional resources to deepen your knowledge:
