## The Five-Step Model in Detail

Let's delve deeper into each step of the ASC 606 five-step model:

**Step 1: Identify the Contract with a Customer**

This involves determining whether an agreement meets the definition of a contract under ASC 606. A contract must have commercial substance, be approved by both parties, and create enforceable rights and obligations.

**Step 2: Identify the Performance Obligations in the Contract**

This step requires identifying the promises made to the customer. Each promise to transfer a distinct good or service is considered a performance obligation. A good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other readily available resources.

**Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price**

The transaction price is the amount of consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer. This may include fixed amounts, variable consideration, or noncash consideration. Estimating variable consideration requires judgment and may involve using either the expected value or the most likely amount.

**Step 4: Allocate the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations**

This step involves allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which the entity would sell the good or service separately to a customer. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, it must be estimated.

**Step 5: Recognize Revenue When (or as) the Entity Satisfies a Performance Obligation**

Revenue is recognized when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised good or service to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. This can occur at a point in time or over time, depending on the nature of the performance obligation.

## Practical Examples of ASC 606 Application

To illustrate the application of ASC 606, consider the following examples:

*   **Software Company:** A software company sells a software license and provides ongoing support services. The contract has two performance obligations: the software license and the support services. The transaction price is allocated between these two obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. Revenue is recognized for the software license at a point in time when the license is delivered to the customer. Revenue is recognized for the support services over time as the services are provided.

*   **Construction Company:** A construction company enters into a contract to build a building. The contract has a single performance obligation: the construction of the building. Revenue is recognized over time as the building is constructed, using a measure of progress such as costs incurred or milestones achieved.

*   **Telecommunications Company:** A telecommunications company sells a bundled package of services, including internet access, television services, and phone services. The contract has three performance obligations: the internet access, the television services, and the phone services. The transaction price is allocated between these three obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. Revenue is recognized for each service over time as the service is provided.
