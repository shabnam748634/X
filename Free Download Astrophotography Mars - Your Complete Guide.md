## Equipment Recommendations

While this course provides a comprehensive overview of the necessary equipment, here are some specific recommendations for different budget levels:

**Beginner:**

*   **Telescope:** A 6-inch to 8-inch Dobsonian telescope provides excellent value for the price and is well-suited for planetary viewing.
*   **Camera:** A dedicated planetary camera (e.g., ZWO ASI120MC-S) offers high frame rates and low noise levels for capturing detailed images.
*   **Filters:** A set of color filters (red, green, blue) can enhance contrast and reveal specific atmospheric features.

**Intermediate:**

*   **Telescope:** An 8-inch to 10-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT) offers a longer focal length and better tracking capabilities for planetary imaging.
*   **Camera:** A more advanced planetary camera (e.g., ZWO ASI290MM) with a larger sensor and higher sensitivity.
*   **Filters:** Methane band filters to highlight atmospheric methane features.

**Advanced:**

*   **Telescope:** A high-end Ritchey-Chrétien telescope (RCT) or a large aperture Dobsonian telescope for maximum light gathering and image resolution.
*   **Camera:** A cooled CCD camera with a high-resolution sensor and low noise levels.
*   **Filters:** Specialized narrowband filters for capturing specific atmospheric emissions.

Remember to invest in a stable mount to minimize vibrations and improve image quality.
